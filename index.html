The Alliance’s policy platform states that no Farm Bill additions should be permitted that further the development of voluntary or compliance-based carbon markets, carbon offsets of any kind, or dirty energy projects.

That decision declared that Oklahoma rightfully remains Indian Territory for criminal jurisdiction, and ever since, Governor Kevin Stitt and his pro-oil “Commission on Cooperative Sovereignty” have fought desperately to overturn it in every legal space available. Chaired by Devon Energy CEO’s Larry Nichols, the commission also includes Continental Resources’ Harold Hamm, pipeline giant Williams Companies’ Alan Armstrong, as well as a litany of fossil fuel industry lobbyists and executives dead set on destroying Oklahoma’s land, air, and water. Convened under the guise of exploring “cooperative sovereignty,” this commission is nothing but a farce, proven by the fact that it excludes actual tribal leadership. Together, Stitt and Big Oil worked in tandem to turn Oklahoma into one giant regulatory rollback to exploit for profit, seeing McGirt – and Oklahoma’s sovereign tribal nations as a major setback. While we know Stitt and Oklahoma’s pro-Oil lobby will continue their anti-Indigenous tirades, we can rest assured knowing, for now at least, Oklahoma’s Tribes retain their sovereignty and are united against the state under Governor Kevin Stitt.</div><hr><h3 style="text-align:start;"><a href="https://www.ienearth.org/indigenous-leaders-pressure-biden-to-stop-line-3-during-minnesota-visit/" rev="en_rl_none" class="en-link">Indigenous Leaders Pressure Biden to Stop Line 3 During Minnesota Visit</a></h3><div class="para"><span style="--darkmode-color: rgb(205, 205, 205); --lightmode-color: rgb(122, 122, 122);" class="UrtAp">(Minnesota) — Tonight, President Biden visited Dakota County Technical College in Rosemount to tout the bipartisan infrastructure package.

Thompson believes that the oil will be exported to countries like China and Venezuela, making it a case where he sees Americans would be taking on all of the risk so that Big Oil and foreign countries could get the reward. Thompson proposes that the pipeline is not about energy security, rather it's a means of getting Canadian tar sands oil to the world's market. The pipeline would not reduce America's dependence on Middle Eastern Oil or enhance our energy independence, it would only benefit the foreign oil industry and Canada.

It will be the first genetically modified fish intended for human consumption in the US, but conservation groups say the fish could easily mix with wild salmon and because of its growth genes, put the entire US salmon industry at risk, and most importantly it could threaten the survival of our native salmon populations.</div><hr><h3 style="text-align:start;"><a href="https://www.ienearth.org/the-tar-sands-are-coming-to-toronto/" rev="en_rl_none" class="en-link">The Tar Sands are Coming to Toronto</a></h3><div class="para">Enbridge has started reversing the direction of its Line 9 pipeline between Sarnia and Montreal to transport tar sands from Alberta to Maine for shipment around the world, creating a third alternative to the Keystone XL pipeline and the Northern Gateway pipeline.

While the petcoke is removed during the refining process, it does not disappear and studies such as the European Commission have indicated that emissions from tar sands-derived fuel are 23% greater than from conventional crude used in Europe. Of 134 US refineries in 2012, 59 were equipped to produce petcoke, which is like coal but is dirtier and even more carbon-intensive. Although some analysts consider emissions from burning petcoke to be negligible as the substance would merely replace coal, it is cheaper, with petcoke selling at around 25% discount to conventional coal, and therefore petcoke production associated with tar sands oil production is helping to make coal-fired power generation cheaper worldwide. Furthermore, petcoke puts another nail in the coffin of any rational argument for further tar sands exploitation.

While one-third of Native Americans in the area own mineral rights, allegedly none of the oil revenues collected by the tribe or the state of North Dakota comes back to the towns and cities on their land.</div><hr><h3 style="text-align:start;"><a href="https://www.ienearth.org/quebec-ontario-pipeline-will-create-eastern-u-s-route-for-oil-groups-warn/" rev="en_rl_none" class="en-link">Quebec-Ontario pipeline will create eastern U.S. route for oil, groups warn</a></h3><img class="x3xxV" src="News Article Summaries files\image (89).png" width="auto" data-resource-hash="0a7bc6620b590f554d5e38e030d03977"><div class="para">Calgary-based company Enbridge has applied to Canada's National Energy Board to reverse the flow of a Quebec-to-Ontario oil pipeline, and to increase the line&amp;rsquo;s capacity from 240,000 barrels per day to 300,000 barrels per day. Members of various environmental groups warn that this is just one step toward creating an eastern route for exports to New England. They believe that the move is a preliminary step towards creating an eastern export route for "dirty oil" from Alberta. Line 9 flowed from west to east when it was built in the 1970s, but it was reversed two decades later to respond to market conditions at the time. The NEB gave Enbridge the green light to reverse a segment of Line 9 between Sarnia, Ont., and Westover during the summer. Eastern refineries currently rely on crude imported from overseas, which is more expensive than oil that comes from Western Canada.</div><hr><h3 style="text-align:start;"><a href="https://www.ienearth.org/contaminated-culture-native-people-struggle-with-tainted-resources-lost-identity/" rev="en_rl_none" class="en-link">Contaminated Culture</a></h3><div class="para">Indigenous people in the US and Canada have been burdened with health problems linked to environmental pollutants for decades.

The housing crisis has been growing worse, particularly within the million-acre Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. The tribe is experiencing severe consequences from lack of proper infrastructure, including crumbling roads, lack of proper sewage facilities in various mancamps, and a severe shortage of adequate housing. It's estimated North Dakota has collected at least $100m from revenue generated through the oil boom at Fort Berthold alone, while the majority of residents haven't seen a penny. Roads are crumbling and some oil trucks have been involved in fatal accidents with at least six of the young people under the age of 27, and the youngest a three-year-old. Crime, drug, and death rates have increased, with prostitution rings forming, and rape rates for both men and women rising. Natural gas is being flared off, spewing at least two million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year. Despite North Dakota having the greatest wind resource in any of the lower 48 states, programs for wind power generation have recently been cut back within the state. According to a tribal member, “This oil boom has divided the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara people and pitted them against each other in a negative way.
